Mobile App Development Report: Challenges, Mistakes, and Lessons Learned

Introduction:
We made a mobile app in Kotlin for browsing movies and picking seats. We faced some tough parts, made mistakes, but learned a lot. Here's what happened.

Challenges:

1. Picking Random Seats: Making the app pick seats randomly and getting it to work smoothly was tough.
2. Making the App Look Right: Designing the app to match what we wanted was a bit tricky.
3. Using External Stuff: Adding real movie pictures and making sure the font was right was harder than expected.

Mistakes:
1. Messy Data Handling: At first, we didn't handle the movie data well, so it caused issues.
2. Seat Picking Problems: Figuring out how to stop people from picking seats they shouldn't was tricky and took a few tries.
3. Not Matching the Design: The app didn't look exactly like what we planned at first.

What I Learned:
1. Better Data Handling: We got better at organizing and using the movie info.
2. Smarter Seat Picking: We fixed the seat picking so it worked better for users.
3. Listening to Design Feedback: Getting feedback on how the app looked helped us make it match the plan better.
4. Improving Resource Use: Adding real movie pictures and using the right font became easier with practice.

Conclusion:
Making this app wasn't easy. i faced challenges, made mistakes, but in the end, i learned a lot. By fixing my mistakes and listening to feedback from friends, i made a better app that works well for users.
